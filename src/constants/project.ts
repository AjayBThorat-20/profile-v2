      discription:
        "I developed a full-stack web application focused on crime data analysis and visualization for law enforcement agencies in India. The platform implements robust security measures through JWT authentication, enabling secure user registration, login functionality, and password recovery systems. I designed and built separate administrative and user interfaces that facilitate CRUD operations for managing crime data, team information, and content management. Leveraging web scraping techniques, I automated the collection and integration of Indian legal acts data, ensuring the platform maintains an up-to-date legal reference database. Additionally, I integrated real-time crime news aggregation, making it a comprehensive solution for law enforcement officials. This system streamlines crime data management while providing actionable insights through data visualization, ultimately supporting more effective law enforcement operations.",

      discription:
        "I engineered a comprehensive LinkedIn Clone, a professional networking platform that mirrors core functionalities of the original platform. The application features secure and streamlined user authentication implemented through Google OAuth using NextAuth.js, enabling seamless user access. I developed a robust backend supporting CRUD operations for dynamic content management, allowing users to create, edit, and manage their posts and professional profiles. The platform's responsive user interface, built with Tailwind CSS, offers both dark and light themes for enhanced user experience across devices. Key features include a personalized home feed, professional networking capabilities, an extensive course listing section, and an events page for professional gatherings. This project demonstrates my ability to create complex, scalable social platforms while maintaining security and user experience standards.",
